      title: SecureVote convenience API
      description:
        >
          An API provided for convenient functions via SecureVote.
          This includes fee-less voting and other such functions.

          While these operations aren't as trustless as interacting with a chain directly,
          they do provide very fast verifiability (by checking the txid, etc) and allow for
          a few features that cannot be done without 3rd parites.
